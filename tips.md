Here are a few tips:

**Tip**: `stty -echo`

**Tip**: `!.`

**Description**: Displays previous filename.

**Tip**: `touch filename.date +%d`

**Description**: Creates a file with the name filename.23 id the date on that day is the 23rd. You can add %m to also have the month in the name. Helps to have a track of when you made a particular file. (date +%d must be within backticks. pls fix this if someone can.)
